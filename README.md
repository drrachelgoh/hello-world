# hello-world

I'm interested in everything related to how students learn from assessment and how teachers collaborate to support student learning. 

I'm currently a Teaching Fellow at the Learning Sciences and Assessment Academic Group. My areas of teaching and advisement revolve around curriculum, assessment and learning. My curriculum goal is to design learning experiences that intrigue teachers and learners to optimize the emancipatory potential of assessment for learning. My school-based consultancy has enabled me to work with school leaders and middle leaders on leading and enacting effective feedback practices in different subject disciplines.

As a Senior Teacher of English Language for several years, I've championed action research, led professional learning teams, and mentored beginning teachers, and out of which, grew my interest in teacher learning, lesson study, and assessment for learning. My personal learning goal is to grow in the ability to walk alongside all learners in their learning and forming of their educational being.

The effect of teachers’ participation in a professional learning programme on their teaching of writing

COPI: Rachel Goh

Duration: 2017-2018

Abstract:

The National Writing Project (NWP) is a professional development programme for teachers in the United States focused on the teaching of writing. In 2014, the English Language Institute of Singapore (ELIS) conducted its first Starter Writing Institute modelled on the Invitational Summer Institute (ISI) of the Chicago Area Writing Project (CAWP), a well-established Writing Project Site of the NWP. In 2016, ELIS was certified by the NWP as an Associated International Writing Site (AIS). This proposed study seeks to inquire into the effect of participation in the professional learning programme on teacher participants’ practice of teaching writing. The positive effect of the ISI on teacher practice has been well documented: (1) in clarifying their sense of the purposes for writing, primarily as a tool for learning and for developing ideas, (2) in their use of writing processes as an organising idea by which to scaffold students’ writing practices, and (3) in linking their teaching of writing to their own experience as writers (Whitney & Friedrich, 2013). However, there are two gaps that this current study would seek to address.  Firstly, none of the reviewed studies has examined the enactment of writing lessons to substantiate the high level of NWP influence self-reported by teacher participants. Secondly, the extant literature has not examined the impact of the work of the NWP in an AIS outside the United States. As a new AIS, it is timely for ELIS to conduct the proposed qualitative inquiry focusing on the effect of the SWI as a professional learning activity on teacher participants’ teaching of writing.

Building a Culture of Collaboration and Listening Pedagogy in Classrooms through Lesson Study for Learning Community: An Exploratory Study in a Primary School in Singapore

Collaborator: Rachel Goh

Duration: 2018 - 2020

Abstract: 

The proposed study explores the implementation of Lesson Study for Learning Community (LSLC) in a Singapore primary school to develop a culture of collaboration and listening pedagogy in classrooms. LSLC is an extension of the Lesson Study (LS) approach developed more recently in Japan and has spread to China, Korea, Indonesia, Taiwan and Vietnam. It has yet to be implemented in Singapore schools although a national survey conducted in 2014 found that 190 schools in Singapore (about 53% of all schools) have implemented Lesson Study in various forms and scale (Lee & Lim, in press). LSLC builds on adaptations of Japanese Lesson Study as advocated by Sato (2008) to bring about a mindset change in how teachers view teaching and learning in the classrooms. It envisions schools and classrooms as learning communities where teachers learn together through Lesson Study to support their students to learn though collaboration. There is also an emphasis on listening pedagogy in the classroom where teaching is seen as not telling but mostly listening (Meier, 2002). Many classrooms suffer from 'narration sickness' where teachers do all the taking while students all the listening (Freire, 1973). Much of classroom talk in Singapore classrooms is teacher-dominated and generally avoids extended discussion (Hogan, 2014). While the notion of listening in classroom is inspiring, it will be a challenge for teachers to make this shift. There have also been efforts on the part of Singapore teachers to use group work but much of how it is done is fraught with problems. This study is an attempt to support teachers in implementing listening pedagogy and collaborative learning through LSLC where they plan, enact, and observe lessons in partnership with NIE faculty. It will explore the implementation process in a primary school cognizant of the challenges involved in bringing about changes in teachers teaching stance. This is important because whether and if so how LSLC change teachers and their classroom practices is unclear. Furthermore, the factors that promote or hinder successful implementation of LSLC remain largely unexplored. Therefore, this study explores the following questions: (1) How do teachers understand and enact a listening stance and collaborative learning in their classroom practice? (2) What are the challenges teachers face when making this fundamental shift from teaching as telling to teaching as listening as well as in their design and implementation of collaborative learning tasks? (3) What are the changes in classroom practices during the implementation of LSLC? (4) What are the changes in students' perception of classroom climate and their motivation to learn?  


Secondary Teachers' and Students’ Experiences of Assessment Feedback

Co-PI: Rachel Goh

Duration: 2019 - 2021

Abstract: 

Assessment drives learning, dictates teacher-student-content interactions of and for learning, and assessment feedback is arguably the most powerful and direct means for teachers to direct students’ actions in addressing (gaps) in their content (knowledge). And Assessment is an emotional experience for teachers and students. Assessment Feedback literature suggests that feedback information should be drafted in ways that is cognizant of how it may be received and acted upon by individual students. Likewise, it is important to understand how teachers and students actually experience assessment feedback practices in their context(s) before prescribing best practices and mandated feedback actions. Meta-analyses and compendiums of reviewed literature consistently conclude that feedback strongly relates to students’ learning outcomes. However, there are subtleties about how and when feedback works, in particular how and how well such feedback is received and interpreted by students, which in turn depends on how well/whether teachers understand each student’s emotional reception and response to feedback in the first place. Studies have consistently shown that students’ academic achievement should positively relate to enjoyment, hope, and pride, and negatively to anger shame, hopelessness and boredom. It was found that detailed descriptive feedback was most effective when delivered without praise or grades. Additional analyses revealed that students in graded conditions experienced higher levels of frustration and sadness, compared to those who received no grade on their performance; whereas students who were praised on their performance tended to experience higher pride, but had lower motivation to engage with feedback (Lipnevich & Smith,, 2009). Recent MOE initiatives articulate the need to balance academic achievement with building students’ confidence and desire to learn, and even a joy for learning. Of ongoing concern in any high performing educational system (such as Singapore) is the impact of assessment on student stress and anxiety. Findings from PISA 2015 reported that 76% of Singapore students had text anxiety (as compared to the international average of 55%) (Davie, 2017. It is submitted that teachers are not immune from assessment and testing stress and anxiety as well. In this light, this study provides teachers’ and students’ a voice in how they have experienced, and would prefer to experience, assessment feedback practices. The findings will reveal how assessment feedback information is perceived by students, as well as what they perceive of having to act on such information. A subsequent phenomenographic study of teachers and students conceptions of feedback practices identifies the variation in experiences of assessment feedback, and suggests what teachers and students can and should be aware of in assessment feedback.
